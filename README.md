# Writing a CRUD application for Django with different paradigm approaches.

This project contains reference examples for writing Django View with functional and OOP paradigms.

## API Endpoints

- GET, POST ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/apis/{version_number}/{plural-model-name}/```
- GET, PUT, DELETE ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/apis/{version_number}/{plural-model-name}/{lookup}/```

Example:
- GET, POST ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/apis/1.0/persons/```

## URL Patterns
```
urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),  #  Admin urls
    path("", include("coreapp.urls")),  #  General link for other applications
    path("f1/", include("f1.urls")),  #  Function Base 1(Bare metal - lack of validations and security)
    path("f2/", include("f2.urls")),  #  Function Base 2(With forms.Forms)
    path("f3/", include("f3.urls")),  #  Function Base 3(With ModelForm)
    path("c1/", include("c1.urls")),  #  Class Base 1(With forms.Forms)
    path("c2/", include("c2.urls")),  #  Class Base 2(With ModelForm)
    path("c3/", include("c3.urls")),  #  Class Base 3(Generic Class Base View)
    path("apis/1.0/", include("apis1.urls")),  #  API 1(Function Base Views)
    path("apis/2.0/", include("apis2.urls")),  #  API 2(Class Base Views)
    path("apis/3.0/", include("apis3.urls")),  #  API 3(Generic Class Base Views)
